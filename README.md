# vagrant-heroku-django-template

A template for setting up a Django 1.6 project with a Vagrant development
machine and support for Heroku.

It is primarily intended for myself for future projects, but feel free
to use it, modify it and what not.

## How to use

    PROJECT_NAME=your_project_name
    mkdir $PROJECT_NAME
    cd $PROJECT_NAME
    ...

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by [vagrant-django-template](https://github.com/torchbox/vagrant-django-template),
but I wanted to make a custom one (that supports Django 1.6 to begin with).
